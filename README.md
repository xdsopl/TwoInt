# Unsigned Integer Implementation with Polar Code Construction Example

This repository provides a C++ implementation of a larger unsigned integer, along with an example that demonstrates the construction of a polar code bit reliability sequence using the implementation.

## Unsigned Integer Implementation

The implementation includes a custom `TwoInt` class, which represents a larger unsigned integer built using nested `TwoInt` objects. The implementation supports basic arithmetic operations, bitwise operations, and comparison operations for large unsigned integers.

To use the `TwoInt` class, include the "two_int.hh" header file in your code and instantiate `TwoInt` objects.

## Polar Code Bit Reliability Sequence Example

The repository also includes an example usage of the `TwoInt` class to construct a polar code bit reliability sequence. The example demonstrates how the `TwoInt` implementation can be utilized to compute the probabilities and sort the bits based on their reliability in a polar code.

To run the example, follow the instructions provided in the example's source file (`polar.cc`). The output will be the generated bit reliability sequence.

## Usage

To use the `TwoInt` implementation or the polar code construction example, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Include the "two_int.hh" header file in your C++ code to use the `TwoInt` class implementation.

3. Refer to the "polar.cc" file for the example usage of the `TwoInt` class to construct a polar code bit reliability sequence. Compile and run the example according to the instructions provided in the source file.
